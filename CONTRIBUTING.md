# Contributing to Oasis Engine  

## Environment  
Oasis Engine is developed using Visual Studio. Since the project uses the Premake build system, Makefiles and XCode projects can be created, but Visual Studio is preferred. Projects can be generated by running the genprojects.ps1 script in the root folder. At present, the project uses Visual Studio Community 2022. This may change at any time, but changes like this must be approved by me before being approved.  

## Coding Style  
Oasis Engine has a specific coding style that should be respected at all times. Note that this does not apply to any third-party libraries (like GLFW). The coding style should be apparent throughout the code. Any inconsistencies should be reported and fixed.

## Workflow  
The development of Oasis Engine works in a simple way. Simply fork the repo and make your changes, then submit a pull request to merge changes. I'm not a robot that works 24/7, so it could take a bit to find your pull request and respond to it. In addition, the `main` branch is always required to be stable. Please don't commit any code that fails either at compile-time or runtime.

## Projects  
When you open the Oasis Engine solution, there are two main projects to focus on, Oasis-Engine and Oasis-Sandbox. Oasis-Engine is the actual engine, and Oasis-Sandbox is a sandbox application for testing the engine. The rest of the projects are just libraries. As a general rule of thumb, anything that starts with "Oasis-" is probably important and related to the engine, and everything else does not matter.  

Happy coding!
