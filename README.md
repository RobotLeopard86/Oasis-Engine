# Oasis Engine  
### A C++ game engine.  

## About  
This project was originally built by following tutorials by [TheCherno on YouTube](https://youtube.com/@TheCherno). The source code for the engine built in the tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel). I eventually plan to expand Oasis Engine with more features after I complete the tutorials. Unlike the Hazel Engine from the videos, the entire full engine will be available for free once complete. Currently the engine is still in development.  

## Planned Features  
* 2D capabilities  
* 3D capabilities  
* Level editor  
* C# scripting system  
* Python scripting system  
* Package manager  
* Windows, Mac, and Linux support  
* WebGL support
* AI Engine

## Platform Support  
Currently, Oasis Engine is only available on Windows. Support for other operating systems will come in the future. I do not intend to support mobile devices or consoles myself, though I would be more than happy to integrate support for those platforms from other contributors.  

## Contributing  
See [the contribution page](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details  

## Attribution  
If you find Oasis Engine useful and decide to make your own version, please give credit to myself and all other project contributors. It means a lot to know that our hard work is being appreciated. Oasis Engine is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, so make sure to respect the license.  

## Third Party Licenses  
Oasis Engine uses multiple third party libraries. As each has different licenses that must be respected, a copy of each is placed in the root directory, named by the library name, which is an exact copy of the license for the respective library.  

Enjoy!
